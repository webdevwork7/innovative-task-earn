# Production Setup Guide for Innovative Task Earn

## Current Status
✅ **All development fallbacks removed** - Platform now operates in production-only mode
✅ **Cashfree Production API configured** - Real ₹99 KYC payments enabled
✅ **Legal compliance complete** - INNOVATIVE GROW SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED entity
✅ **No mock data** - All APIs require authentic database connections

## Required Steps to Enable Full Production Mode

### 1. Database Activation **[CRITICAL]**
**Current Issue**: Neon database endpoint is disabled
**Solution**: Enable the database endpoint in your Neon dashboard

```bash
# Error message indicates:
# "The endpoint has been disabled. Enable it using Neon API and retry."
```

**Steps to fix**:
1. Log into your Neon dashboard
2. Find your database project
3. Navigate to the endpoint settings
4. **Enable the database endpoint**
5. Once enabled, the platform will automatically connect

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
Ensure these production secrets are configured:

```bash
# Production Database (Already configured)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." 

# Session Security (Required for production)
SESSION_SECRET="your-secure-session-secret-key"

# Cashfree Production API (Already configured)
CASHFREE_APP_ID="your-production-app-id"
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY="your-production-secret-key"

# Optional: Gmail SMTP for email verification
GMAIL_EMAIL="your-business-email@gmail.com"
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
```

### 3. Database Schema Deployment
Once database endpoint is enabled, run:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

This will create all necessary tables for:
- User management and authentication
